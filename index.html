          <h3><strong>Stonebank's Start</strong></h3>
          <p><span>Stonebank came on to the Monstercat scene in 2014 with the Song "Eagle Eyes" featuring Emel, pronounced ML. Yet that was not the first track Michael Stonebank released. His first tracks were under the name 'Modulate'. I did not know that, but it is great to know that he started producing music before I found his music.</p>
          <p><span>Many of his songs hit a multitude of genres, but most of them are a harcore dance, to trap music, to one of them being classed as Trance. All of his songs and all of his music makes me want to break into a dance routine, but I cannot for the life of me, dance worth a dime.</p>

          <h3><strong>Career</strong></h3>
          <p><span>Stonebank's career lifted off in 2014 with the release of Eagle Eyes. It goes to show that over the past five years, Stonebank has made over thirty songs. All of these songs consist of a multitude of genres. Some of those being Trap, Drumstep, Drum and Bass, House, Hardstyle, Electronic, and Happy Hardcore.</p>
          <p><span>As the genres above imply, the Song 'Ripped to Pieces',(Album cover pictured above), is considered Happy Hardcore, or Hard Dance. 'The Only One' is a nice song mixed with drums, vocals, and nice driving message of being alone on top of the world, in a good way. 'Drop Bombs' is what is classified as Drumstep, and it sounds exactly like it implies; drums with a dubstep beat. The bass drops are what define these tpyes of song, it just resonates with you and more often than not, you find yourself doing random movements with your hands.</p>
