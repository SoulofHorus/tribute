          <h3><strong>Stonebank's Start</strong></h3>
          <p><span>Stonebank came on to the Monstercat scene in 2014 with the Song "Eagle Eyes" featuring Emel, pronounced ML. Yet that was not the first track Michael Stonebank released. His first tracks were under the name 'Modulate'. I did not know that, but it is great to know that he started producing music before I found his music.</p>
          <p><span>Many of his songs hit a multitude of genres, but most of them are a harcore dance, to trap music, to one of them being classed as Trance. </p>
